                                    <p>
                                        The CAC understands that child abuse is an extremely difficult subject to talk about. Your child is brave for
                                        sharing their story and helping other children escape abuse. Any hint or suspicion of abuse of your child 
                                        causes many strong and confusing emotions. The process of determining what happened to your child and how 
                                        to proceed from there may seem quite overwhelming. It is our job to work together to reduce the number of

                                            The team consists of State’s Attorneys (prosecutors), law enforcement officers, DCFS investigators, social workers, 
                                            medical practitioners, and mental health professionals.

                                    </ol>
                                    <h6>Facts About The Investigation: </h6>
                                    <p>
                                        The investigation of the abuse will take place by a team of professionals, which typically includes a State’s Attorney, 
                                        DCFS investigator, police detective, and Advocacy Center staff. The team approach to these cases keeps the process as 
                                        simple as possible. At times, you may be asked to wait while your child is being interviewed. Being left out of some 
                                        of the proceedings can make you feel uncomfortable and worried. Our Protocol requires that parents not be present 
                                        during the interview because it is felt that more accurate information will be obtained if you are not there. 
                                        In your presence, your child may be unwilling to tell important details because she wants to spare you from hearing 
                                        them. Sometimes parents cannot control their emotions because of what they hear, or they may place pressure on the child 
                                        to tell in a way that can complicate the legal process.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The interviewer will take time to make sure your child is comfortable with them and will make sure your child knows 
                                        you are available if they need you. Your child will know where you are while they are being interviewed.
                                        The legal process moves at its own pace, which is different from your child’s need to heal. Emotional wounds may be 
                                        reopened by the various proceedings, which can take place over several months. The court date may be delayed over and 
                                        over again. You have no control over this, so try to be patient. Remember that people are working to gain the best 
                                        outcome for you and your child.
                                        The legal system was not designed with the needs of the victim in mind. The system is designed primarily to protect 
                                        the rights of the accused, not the victim. The rights of the victim are far less defined than the rights of the 
                                        accused. However, efforts are being made to improve the legal system’s response to child abuse cases.

                                            filed. Consideration is given to many factors that will affect the likelihood 
                                            of success in court. Some of the factors considered are: age and maturity of 
                                            the child, the child’s ability to testify, whether or not the suspect has 
                                            confessed, presence of medical evidence, and whether or not there are other 
                                            witnesses.

											follow the instructions of your medical professional.

                                        <li>If criminal charges are filed, the person accused of abusing the child may be <b>arrested</b> 
                                            (or he may receive a <b>summons</b>) and must go to court for an <b>arraignment</b>.</li>
                                        
                                        <li>
                                            The <b>arraignment</b> is when the person accused of abusing the child (called the <b>defendant</b>) 
                                            appears before the judge and pleads guilty or not guilty to the charges. If the defendant 
                                            pleads guilty, sentencing will be scheduled for a later date (note: defendants almost never 
                                            plead guilty at arraignment). If the defendant pleads not guilty, the case will continue 
                                            through the court process. If the defendant cannot afford an attorney, the judge will 
                                            appoint an attorney to represent him. Also at this stage, bond is set by a judge. If the 
                                            defendant cannot post bond, he will remain in custody while the case is pending.

                                            There are two types of hearings that may occur before trial: a <b>Preliminary Hearing</b> or a 
                                            <b>Grand Jury</b> Hearing . The Preliminary Hearing will take place before a judge in open court and 
                                            the judge will review the evidence and testimony and decide if there is enough evidence for the
                                            case to proceed to a trial. A Grand Jury Hearing is held in private before a jury. The defendant
                                            and defense attorney do not attend. The Grand Jury reviews the evidence and decides if there is
                                            enough evidence to hold the defendant over for a possible trial.
                                        </li>

                                            The defendant will have an attorney; this is the <b>defense attorney</b>. This lawyer may want to talk 
                                            to your child or you before the trial date. It is your choice whether or not you talk to this person. 
											You do not have to talk to the defendant’s attorney.
                                        </li>
                                        
                                        <li>
                                            If there is a <b>Trial</b>, the defense chooses if they want a <b>Bench Trial</b> or a <b>Jury Trial</b>. A bench 
                                            trial is held before a judge. A jury trial is held before a judge and 12 jurors. During the trial,
                                            you and your child might have to testify. The defendant does not have to testify. It may take 
                                            several months from the time charges are filed until you go to court for trial. When you do go
                                            to court with your child, take along a quiet toy, coloring book, or something to keep your 
                                            child busy for what might be a long wait.
                                        </li>

                                            Once all the evidence and testimony is presented, there will be a <b>Verdict</b> of guilty or not guilty. 
                                            If found not guilty, the defendant will be released if he has no other pending charges. If found 
                                            guilty, the defendant will be sentenced at a later date (<b>Sentencing Hearing</b>).
                                            Prior to the Sentencing Hearing, you will be contacted by a Victim Witness Advocate from from the State’s Attorney’s
                                            Office and asked to complete a Victim Impact Statement. Please note, either you or your child, or both,
                                            may complete a Victim Impact Statement. The judge will read the Victim Impact Statement before he 
                                            decides what sentence to impose upon the defendant. You and/or your child will also have the 
                                            opportunity, if you choose, to read your Victim Impact Statement to the Court at the Sentencing
                                            Hearing. The State’s Attorney’s Office will help you prepare your Victim Impact Statement.
                                        </li>
                                        
                                        <li>
                                            The case can also be settled by agreement without a trial. This is called a <b>Plea Bargain</b>. 
                                            A plea bargain may take place between the prosecuting attorney and the defense attorney at 
                                            any time and is reached when the attorneys agree on a charge and a sentence. If the judge 
                                            accepts the plea bargain, there will not be a trial. Although a plea bargain insures that 
                                            the defendant will be convicted, oftentimes it results in a lesser sentence. As a result 
                                            of a plea bargain, a conviction will appear on the offender’s record and he/she may have 
                                            to register as a sex offender.
                                            Many times, a defendant will plead guilty but there is no agreement between the attorneys 
                                            about what sentence to recommend. In that event, the case may be continued for a <b>Sentencing 
                                            Hearing</b>, at which time a judge will decide the sentence to be imposed. If that happens, 
                                            you will be contacted by the State’s Attorney’s Office and asked to complete a 
                                            <b>Victim Impact Statement</b> (see above).
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>
                                        Always remember that the well being of your child should be your objective. Don’t lose yourself in
										the legal system, because it is only one step in the process, and it is not essential to your child’s recovery.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The best advice is to enter the legal system without expectations, because the more you expect from the system, 
                                        the harder the experience is likely to be. Also, remember to celebrate when it is over. No matter what the outcome,
                                        conviction or not, tell your child it is over. You and your child did your best, worked hard, and put in a 
                                        lot of time and courage. Celebrate a job well done!
