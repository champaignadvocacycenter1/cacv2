                                        It is exceeding important to make sure that the process of interviewing
                                        the child and moving forward legally is done properly and in a way that doesn't hurt
                                        the child further. It is equally important to help the child and their family heal from

                                        In 2017, the Champaign County Children’s Advocacy Center facilitated over 
										230 interviews. Considering that child abuse is one of the most underreported

										injustice. Everyone can contribute in some way to wiping out this horrible
										epidemic and helping victims of child abuse heal.

                                        In 2002, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services received
                                        143 reports of children being sexually abused in Champaign County. Considering
                                        that child sexual abuse is one of the most underreported crimes, an even greater
                                        number of children are victims of this horrific injustice. As part of a community
                                        that actively promotes the well-being of every child, your involvement will
                                        directly reduce the number of crimes committed against our children.

                                        There are many ways you can support the important work that happens 
										at the CAC. The growth and continuation of the services provided by
										the Children’s Advocacy Center depends upon the public’s understanding
										of its mission. Community support and education is crucial to the 
										prevention of child abuse. By working together, we can stamp out child
										abuse cases within our community. We live in a time where violence 
										permeates our society. If we are to make a substantial impact on child
										abuse and the negative toll it takes on our community, we have to make
										changes within our communities and our society as a whole. Our society
										says it is OK to call animal protection when our neighbor abuses his 
										or her pet; however, we are told it is none of our business when that
										neighbor abuses a child. It is you---- the neighbor, friend, family 
										member---who may see, hear, or even witness child abuse.

                                        All services provided by the CAC are free. We receive funding from the 
										state and federal governments to supplement the cost of operation, but 
										it is often not enough. This means the CAC has to rely on private donations
										from individuals within the community and beyond to help pay for counseling
										services for the victims we serve in Champaign and Ford Counties. All 
										monetary donations are used to provide direct support and services to 
										the children we serve and their non-offending family members.

                                        children that are referred to us after sexual abuse has been reported, each with the 
                                        potential to live meaningful life, free of mental struggles (reword) cause by abuse. 
                                        Any donation is appreciated; however, child sexual abuse is an inevitable (reword)
                                        problem. Every year there are new cases reported to the authorities that requires our
