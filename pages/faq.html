                                    <p>
                                        Since some childhood sexual activity is normal, it is important to 
                                        understand how child sexual abuse is defined. In the broadest 
                                        definition, child sexual abuse may refer to any forced or coerced 
                                        sexual activity involving a child:
                                    </p>

                                        <li>
                                            Sexual contact between a child and another person (whether it is 
                                            an adult or an older child) in which threats, treats, bribes, or 
                                            other tricks are used to get the child to participate in the 
                                            activity.
                                        </li>

                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Forced sexual acts between children.

                                            Some abuse may not involve actual physical contact. This might include:

                                            "sexting")
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>
                                        Often, the abuser will persuade the child to cooperate and to keep the 
                                        abuse a secret. This “persuasion” may involve the promise of special 
                                        treats or privileges, or threats of physical punishment and other consequences. 
                                        Or, the abuser may not need to make any threats. Children are taught to obey 
                                        and trust adults and the abuser may take advantage of this, especially if he 
                                        is a person the child knows well and trusts.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Children tend to believe what adults tell them is true rather than to rely 
                                        on their own feelings. This works against them in two ways. If the molester 
                                        tells them what is being done is OK, they may doubt their own feelings that 
                                        it is not OK. If a parent’s initial reaction when they hear of the abuse is 
                                        <i>“This can’t be true!”</i> the child may wonder if his or her own feelings 
                                        are mistaken. Children almost never tell about abuse in order to avoid causing 
                                        problems. More often, they fear that telling will make people angry with them. 
                                        <i><b>It is extremely difficult for children to report abuse and the process of 
                                        disclosing abuse sometimes occurs over a long period of time. Be patient with 
                                        your child.</b></i>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Too many times, a child will not even realize they are being abused. In other 
                                        situations, the child may feel ashamed or otherwise unable to come forward. 
                                        That is why it is so important that the adults treat children who come forward 
                                        like the heroes they are. It takes immense bravery to disclose abuse and the 
                                        child will require support to heal.

                                    <p>
                                        People who abuse children come from all economic and ethnic 
                                        groups and a variety of social and educational backgrounds.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        According to research, approximately 90% of all sexual abuse 
                                        of children is perpetrated by someone the child knows. Many 
                                        abusers are trusted and loved by the child such as a relative, 
                                        friend, or neighbor.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It is impossible to discern an abuser by their appearance alone. 
                                        Most do not fit the stereotypical that probably comes to mind. 
                                        Abusers may be seemingly well adjusted outstanding citizens. 
                                        Some even have families of their own or are children themselves.
                                    </p>

                                        Children can sexually abuse other children. Often, the contact is 
                                        out of curiosity but in some cases, usually when one child is 
                                        much older and or bigger than the other, the behavior may be 
                                        abusive. If behavior between children becomes sexually suggestive 
                                        and or comes across as abuse, intervene!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Many parents find it difficult to accept that their children were 
                                        abused—oftentimes right under their nose. Offenders will go to great 
                                        lengths to abuse children and gain access.

                                            Seek out an approachable child, one who is easy to get to such as 
                                            a relative, neighbor, or friend.

                                            Establish a relationship with the child by spending time playing 
                                            with them, volunteering to babysit, becoming their buddy, or buying 
                                            them games or presents.

                                            Break down the child’s resistance to touch by playing games that 
                                            involve touching such as wrestling and tickling. As a result, 
                                            children are often confused when the touch becomes sexual.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Find ways to be alone with the child such as babysitting, inviting 
                                            them to sleep over, or taking them camping.
                                        </li>

                                            Blame the child and coerce them to keep the secret by making the child 
                                            feel responsible so they won’t tell. They say things like:

                                            <i>“You know you like the way I touch you.”</i>

                                        Children react differently to the abuse depending on age, extent of abuse, support from others, 
                                        and their relationship with the offender. You should be aware of any changes in your child’s behavior 
                                        or disposition, but some children are not visibly changed by the experience. Do not look too hard for 
                                        things that are not there.

                                        Your child’s reaction depends very much on how you and other important people handle the situation.

                                    <h1>How Parents Sometimes Feel When Abuse Has Been Reported</h1>
                                    <hr>

                                    <p>
                                        When abuse is reported, parents sometimes feel as if they are on a 
                                        roller coaster of emotions. This is normal. The report can affect 
                                        your life in many ways, and it takes time to adjust. Following are 
                                        some of the common thoughts and feelings parents have.
                                    </p>

                                            <i>Denial. </i>
                                            Your first reaction may be not to believe or not to accept the fact 
                                            that it really happened. Or you may believe it happened, but that 
                                            no real harm was done. Parents often experience denial because it is 
                                            too overwhelming to accept that the abuse occurred and that there will 
                                            be aftereffects.

                                            You may feel angry with yourself for not protecting your child. You 
                                            may feel angry with the perpetrator for what he did. Be honest about 
                                            your feelings and share them with a trusted person or group.

                                            You probably do not know what to expect and can feel that things are out 
                                            of your control. Try to stay aware of how your case is proceeding and ask 
                                            questions of the professionals that are involved with you.

                                            You may feel invisible and think there is nothing you can do to help the 
                                            situation get better. You can take care of your child and be sure she is 
                                            receiving all the help she needs.

                                            You may have memories of being abused as a child. This can lead to shock, 
                                            numbness, and repulsion. If so, you may need to seek counseling for yourself 
                                            to help you recover so that you can help your child recover.

                                            You may feel it is all your fault. Remember, the offender is responsible for 
                                            the abuse, not you. The best thing you can do now is support your child and 
                                            learn all you can about how to make things better.

                                            It is normal to feel hurt from the loss of your child’s innocence. You may 
                                            have lost a spouse or partner if that person was the offender. You may even 
                                            have lost friends. It is very important to grieve for these losses.

                                    <h1>How Should I Act Toward My Child?</h1>
                                    <hr>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Be patient and kind. Provide safety, love, and support. Allow your child to 
                                            express their feelings, and let your child know it is OK to cry or be mad.  
                                            Make sure your child knows it was not their fault and they are not to blame 
                                            for what happened. Explain to your child that you may get mad or cry too, 
                                            but make sure your child always knows you are not mad at them.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Do not pressure your child to talk about the experience. If the 
                                            subject comes up, discuss it honestly and openly. Answer your 
                                            child’s questions to the best of your ability. Allow your child 
                                            to be involved in decision making so that a sense of control over 
                                            their environment can be regained.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Try to return to your family’s normal routine as soon as possible. A familiar 
                                            and stable routine will be very helpful for you and your child. Avoid becoming 
                                            overprotective of your child. Give your child safety information, but avoid 
                                            causing them to become more fearful than they already are. Help them identify 
                                            safe people they can go to when they are scared or sad.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            See that your child receives therapy as soon as possible. Trying to avoid 
                                            the problem will usually cause more problems because it will not go away. 
                                            Your child is experiencing quite a few emotions that they may not know how 
                                            to deal with. They have many questions they need answered. The sooner the 
                                            child gets therapy, the better they will be able to cope in the future.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            This kind of experience affects the whole family. Pay attention to the 
                                            needs of the other children in your home as well. Understand that it is 
                                            a natural reaction for siblings to blame or resent the victimized child 
                                            for disruption caused following a report of abuse. Give them the support 
                                            and information they need to cope with their feelings and concerns.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Some things you can say to your child that will really help:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>I believe you.</li>
                                                <li>I know it’s not your fault.</li>
                                                <li>I’m glad I know about what happened.</li>
                                                <li>I’m sorry this happened to you.</li>
                                                <li>I will take care of you.</li>
                                                <li>I’m upset, but not with you. I’m upset at the person that did this.</li>
                                                <li>Nothing about you made this happen. It has happened to other kids too.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
