                                        the child and moving forward legally is done properly and in a way that doesn't hurt
                                        the child further. It is equally important to help the child and their family heal from

                                        In 2002, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services received
                                        143 reports of children being sexually abused in Champaign County. Considering
                                        that child sexual abuse is one of the most underreported crimes, an even greater
                                        number of children are victims of this horrific injustice. As part of a community
                                        that actively promotes the well-being of every child, your involvement will
                                        directly reduce the number of crimes committed against our children.

                                        The growth and continuation of the Children's Advocacy Center depends upon the 
                                        public's understanding of its mission. Since child abuse is a community problem,
                                        community support is crucial to the prevention of abuse. By working together,
                                        we can stamp out child abuse cases in our community.

                                        We live in a time in which violence permeates our culture. If we are to make a 
                                        substantial impact on violence and its cost to our communities, we have to change 
                                        our methods and, in effect, our culture. Our society says it is OK to call animal 
                                        protection when our neighbor mistreats his or her pet; however, we are told it is 
                                        none of our business when that neighbor mistreats his or her children. 
                                        It is you--the neighbor, friend and extended family member--who may see, hear 
                                        and even witness child maltreatment.

                                        All services at the CAC are free. We strongly believe families should not be burdened
                                        with the financial cost of legal proceedings to bring justice to the offender or
                                        the therapy required to recover from the actions of that person. We receive funding
                                        from the state and federal government to supplement the cost of operation, but it is
                                        often not enough. This requires the CAC to rely on the private donations of individuals
                                        in the community to help pay for services such as therapy for the children. Every child
                                        helped at our facility is a child that lives in Champaign or Ford county.

                                    <p> All donations collected are spent to help the victims of child sexual abuse and severe
                                        physical abuse recover. Each donation can be thought of as an investment into our community. 
                                        By donating to our organization, you are guaranteeing each child who visits the CAC is 
                                        supplied proper assistance in the journey to recovery. Annually, there are over 200 
                                        children that are referred to us after sexual abuse has been reported, each with the 
                                        potential to live meaningful life, free of mental struggles (reword) cause by abuse. 
                                        Any donation is appreciated; however, child sexual abuse is an inevitable (reword)
                                        problem. Every year there are new cases reported to the authorities that requires our
                                        services. Recurring donations help us keep our doors open so we can continuously help
                                        those affected year after year. Please use the donation box below to make sure children 
                                        get the help they deserve
