												promoted to the Director of a Day Care and remained there for 5 years. 
												After moving to Indiana, Kari was the program coordinator of a child and
												adolescent program serving children with a mental health diagnosis. Kari
												moved back to Champaign in 2007 and became the Child & Family Services 
												Manager at Champaign County Head Start where she worked for 9 years. In
												February of 2017 Kari became the Executive Director of the Children’s 
												Advocacy Center of Champaign and Ford Counties.
 
												Kari’s most important accomplishments are her two adopted children, Jami age 8 and Andrew age 11.
