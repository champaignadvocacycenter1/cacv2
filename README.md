# Project Title

This is a webpage built for the Champaign County Children's Advocacy Center through 
the course CS465/ADV492 taught by Mike Yao at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
The purpose of this assignment was to meet and deliver a product for a client in a group.
We built this webpage for the Champaign County Children's Advocacy Center to offer a unified
place for children and parents coming into the facility to find information and literature
about what to expect, as well as a place where possible donors would come and learn about
how the CCCAC benefits the community. 

This site was built with simplicity, easy maintainablity, and responsiveness in mind. 
By using plain vanilla HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, we can deploy this website without
the use of any databases or frameworks. There is little to no backend maintenance to be 
done.
