                                        The Children's Advocacy Center is a facility-based community 
                                        partnership dedicated to a team approach by professionals 
                                        pursuing the truth in child abuse investigations. Professionals 
                                        from child protective services, law enforcement, prosecution, 
                                        victim advocacy agencies and the medical and mental health 
                                        communities come together to investigate and intervene in cases 
                                        of suspected child sexual and serious physical abuse. Attention 
                                        to the needs and abilities of children is a hallmark of the 
                                        Children's Advocacy Center. Designed as a safe and welcoming 
                                        place for children to be heard, the CAC ensures that children 
                                        are not further victimized by the systems intended to protect 
                                        them.

                                            Children's Advocacy Centers are child-focused, facility based 
                                            programs in which representatives from responsible agencies meet 
                                            to discuss and make decisions about the investigation, treatment 
                                            and prosecution of child sexual abuse and severe physical abuse 
                                            cases. This multidisciplinary approach brings together under 
                                            one umbrella all the professionals and agencies needed to offer 
                                            comprehensive services: law enforcement, child protective services, 
                                            prosecution, victim advocacy agencies, and the mental health and

                                        <b>More efficient medical and mental health referrals. </b>
                                        Open communication and case coordination facilitates the timeliness 
                                        with which the child and family receive needed service. Children 
                                        receive prompt and ongoing services that are tailored to their specific 
                                        needs and family situations. Interagency agreements between the Center 
                                        and other social service agencies assure that children receive prompt 
                                        medical care and mental health therapy.

                                        <b>Reduction in the number of child victim interviews. </b>
                                        The multidisciplinary team coordinates the interview of the child and 
                                        non-offending family members at the Center. By coordinating the interview, 
                                        the child is not subjected to multiple interviews by multiple agencies 
                                        involved in handling the case.

                                        <b>Increased successful prosecution. </b>
                                        More offenders are held accountable through improved prosecution of child 
                                        abuse cases. By coordinating the process of how information is collected 
                                        and disseminated, child advocacy centers improve the quality of information 
                                        provided to prosecutors and juvenile court attorneys. Experienced professionals 
                                        who have been specially-trained to interview children thoroughly investigate 
                                        allegations of abuse. Their child-focused approach produces a greater quantity 
                                        of reliable information used in criminal, civil and juvenile court proceedings.

                                        <b>Consistent support for child victims and supportive adults.</b>
                                        More non-offending parents are empowered to protect and support their children 
                                        throughout the intervention process and beyond. The Center will assure that 
                                        families receive specialized services when necessary. Through the Center, 
                                        each child and his or her family is assisted throughout the process in both 
                                        juvenile and criminal court.
